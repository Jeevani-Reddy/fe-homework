React Homework

Attached is a layout of what the homework will look like once you have completed building it in react. 

Following are the tasks that should be completed on your end. The goal of this homework is to see your approach with setting up an application. When the repository is cloned on our end, all below tasks should be completed and be able to run in a local instance.

Application Level
1) Create a Git Repository that can be shared
2) Set up basic React application in the git repository

Home Page - Create New User
1) The Home page (with Create New User) consists of a header, navigation on the left and page content
2) On the left, in navigation, the link under Category 1 should route to the page Create User form page and the link under Category 2 should route to the page Edit User Page.
3) The Create New User button should route to the Create User Form Page. 
4) The Edit existing User Form should redirect to Edit User Page
5) Logout link should redirect to a plain page with a message saying "Logout Successful" 
6) The icon on the left top “Application Name” Should act as Home Page link. No matter where you are on the application, when clicked, should bring the user to the home page (Page 1 of PDF)

Second Page - Create New User
1) Set up User Form w/ validation (Form should show error message if fields are left blank)
2) Once the user is created, the user details should show right under the form. The users First & Last name should show up.
3) Next to each user that shows up, an edit link should be present which when clicked will take you to the third page (Edit User Page). 
4) Optional - Have the edit link redirect to User Edit form page with form being populated with user details (first name, last name, email address)

Edit Existing User Form
1) Set up edit existing user form w/ validation (Form should show error message if the email address, first name or last name does not match existing user)
2) Upon clicking save button, the updated user should be saved and displayed right below the form. 


The application when cloned, should work without any issues with all the above implemented.
